### Ball-Motion
A simple third-person maze project where the user controls a ball and navigates to reach the end of the maze.

### Mini_Solar_Sys
A small scale working model of the solar system.  Utilizes lighting for the sun, then creates orbital routes for each of the nine (yes, includes Pluto!) planets and even Earth's moon.

### Swords and Shovels
A level model for a video game entitled "Swords and Shovels".  The player controls a 3d player, armed with a sword and navigates a level built from scratch.  The level includes a rickety bridge, some stairs, a target door, a side following camera,and a patrolling npc.  This was built as part of a tutorial to learn how to script NPC and player movements, build post-production quality levels, and create specified camera actions. 

### Space Maze
A personal project, this game is a third-person shooter in which the player navigates a maze of hallways on a space station, filled with npc patrolling monsters.  The player can shoot and run to escape from the monsters.  This project highlights using animations and player variables to create a working level model where the player can destroy npcs and even die if they take too much damage.  Using a lot of colliders and scripting as well as erie sound effects, this game gives a realistic feel to a sci-fi based game.  The file sizes are too large to include on GitHub, but I have the ability to send a .zip with the build if you would like to try it out.  While it is not perfect, it demonstrates all of the necessary skills a beginning developer might need to create their own game.
